## Bio

I am a scientist at the University of [Wisconsin-Madison(https://www.wisc.edu/) with years of experience in using and teaching computers and software. I create, organize and teach hands-on workshops on Next Generation Sequencing "*using a computer we cannot see, without a mouse*" *i.e.* using terminal to a remote Linux system. Other workshops are related to data analysis or 3D visualization of molecules.

I started as a bench scientist, but quickly moved to using computers for DNA sequence analysis and 3D visualization of macro-molecules, with icosahedral viruses a specific focus for almost 3 decades.
